# doc-dev: docs/ci/03-metric-history-gate.md
"""Deferred Neon (hosted Postgres) backend for the metric-history store.

* An intentional placeholder: the hosted backend is not wired this round -- no
  Postgres driver is added to `requirements.txt` and nothing here opens a
  connection.
* The class exists so the gate can name its production backend and so the
  connection contract (the `NEON_DATABASE_URL` env var, provisioned
  out-of-band) is documented in one place.

Implementation notes for whoever lands the real driver:

* Add a driver (`psycopg[binary]` or `asyncpg`) to `requirements.txt`
  only when this is implemented -- not before.
* Read the DSN from the `NEON_DATABASE_URL` environment variable. Do not
  embed credentials and do not hardcode the host.
* Provision the schema and connection role out-of-band for now. The store's
  read/write path must remain DML-only: insert runs, read baselines, and mark
  runs untrusted.
* `recent_trusted_values` must use the authoritative baseline query verbatim
  (`sub_label IS NOT DISTINCT FROM %s`), so its results match
  :class:`~tests.ci.metric_history.storage.sqlite_store.SQLiteMetricHistoryStore`.
