"""Storage contract for the CI metric-history regression gate.

* The gate compares a candidate run's metrics against a baseline assembled
  from the most recent *trusted* runs that share the same test identity.
* Two normalized tables back the contract. ``runs`` -- one row per CI
  execution of a test, holding identity (test_path, backend, suite,
  test_file_hash), provenance (commit_sha, pr_number, github_run_id,
  github_run_attempt, event_name, ref), the ``created_at`` timestamp, and
  the run-level ``trusted`` flag.
* ``metric_values`` -- the (metric_key, sub_label, value) measurements
  produced by a run, keyed back to ``runs`` by ``run_id``.
* ``trusted`` lives on the run, not on the metric: a run is trusted as a
  whole or not at all, so revoking trust drops every metric the run
  contributed in one operation.
* ``test_file_hash`` is the sha256 of the test file's contents, computed by
  the caller; the store only stores and matches on it. Runs of the same
  ``test_path`` with different file contents get different hashes and never
  share a baseline -- a test edit starts a fresh history rather than
  silently comparing against measurements of older code.
* This module defines that storage contract and nothing else: it does not
  decide what counts as a regression, does not read the candidate run, and
  does not talk to CI.
