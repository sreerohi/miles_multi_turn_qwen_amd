"""The band constraint for the CI regression gate.

* A constraint decides whether one extracted scalar `cur` passes against a
  reference `ref`. The *same* constraint is applied twice -- `ref` is the
  spec's static `hard_ref` for the hard gate, or the mean of the trusted
  baseline for the historical gate.
* One band family, no name dispatch: `band = max(rel * |ref|, abs_floor)`.
  `rel` is a relative percentage; `abs_floor` keeps a metric riding near zero
  (where `rel * |ref|` vanishes) from flagging on a meaningless relative
  percentage.
* `direction` narrows what counts as a failure: `two_sided` -- any
  deviation beyond the band fails; `higher_is_worse` -- only an increase
  beyond the band fails (a drop passes); `lower_is_worse` -- only a decrease
  beyond the band fails (a rise passes).
* The declaration literal is validated against :data:`CONSTRAINT_SCHEMA` at
  parse time; `evaluate_constraint` expects the normalized dict (defaults
  filled). The literal as written is the spec's `rule_key`, part of the
  stored value's identity (see register.py).
