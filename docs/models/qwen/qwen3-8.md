title: Qwen3.8
description: Launch recipe for the dense Qwen3.8-27B, plus where the 2.4T-A95B MoE recipe lives.
---
## 1. Model Introduction

[Qwen3.8](https://github.com/QwenLM/Qwen3) continues Alibaba's Qwen3 line. The
dense **Qwen3.8-27B** ships the same `config.json` as
[Qwen3.5-27B](/models/qwen/qwen3-5) and [Qwen3.6-27B](/models/qwen/qwen3-6) —
same hybrid GDN backbone, same gated attention, same tokenizer and vocabulary.
It therefore reuses the Qwen3.5 Megatron spec
(`miles_plugins.models.qwen3_5.get_qwen3_5_spec`), and
`scripts/models/qwen3.8-27B.py` is a one-line derivation of the Qwen3.5-27B
model args; the three expand to byte-identical Megatron flags.

The sparse **Qwen3.8-2.4T-A95B** is a different recipe entirely — see
[section 6](#6-qwen38-24t-a95b).

**Key highlights (27 B):**

- **Dense GDN backbone**: 27 B parameters, hybrid linear / full attention (`full_attention_interval 4`).
- **Attention-output gate**: shared with Qwen3.5, trained alongside attention weights.
- **Extended rotary base**: `--rotary-base 10000000`, `--rotary-percent 0.25`.
- **Larger vocabulary**: 248320 tokens.
- **Shape**: `hidden-size 5120`, `ffn-hidden-size 17408`, 64 layers.
- **Multimodal**: `Qwen3_5ForConditionalGeneration`; the RL recipe below trains the text path only.

## 2. Supported Variants

| Model | Class | HF ID | Recipe |

## 3. Environment Setup

### 3.1 Download model + datasets

```bash
hf download Qwen/Qwen3.8-27B --local-dir /root/models/Qwen3.8-27B
hf download --repo-type dataset zhuzilin/dapo-math-17k --local-dir /root/datasets/dapo-math-17k
hf download --repo-type dataset zhuzilin/aime-2024     --local-dir /root/datasets/aime-2024
```

### 3.2 HF → Megatron `torch_dist` conversion

Run it on all eight GPUs; the tool shards the 64 layers over the ranks
(`--pipeline-model-parallel-size` is derived from `WORLD_SIZE`) and the output
re-shards at load, so the conversion layout does not have to match the training one:

```bash
cd /root/miles
MODEL_ARGS_LINE="$(python3 miles/utils/external_utils/model_args_utils.py qwen3.8-27B)" || exit 1
read -ra MODEL_ARGS <<< "${MODEL_ARGS_LINE}"
PYTHONPATH=/root/Megatron-LM torchrun --nproc-per-node 8 \
   tools/convert_hf_to_torch_dist.py \
   "${MODEL_ARGS[@]}" \
   --hf-checkpoint /root/models/Qwen3.8-27B \
   --save          /root/models/Qwen3.8-27B_torch_dist
```

## 4. Launch

### 4.1 Quick start

```bash
cd /root/miles
python scripts/run_qwen3_dense.py --model-name Qwen3.8-27B
```

`scripts/run_qwen3_dense.py` is the shared dense launcher; `--model-name Qwen3.8-27B`
selects this recipe, which targets 1 node × 8 GPU. Checkpoints come from `--model-dir`
(default `/root/models`) and datasets from `--data-dir` (default `/root/datasets`);
checkpoints are written under `--output-dir` (default `/root/shared_data`).

### 4.2 What one step costs

Measured on 1 × 8 H200 with the recipe below, `rollout-batch-size 32`,
`n-samples-per-prompt 8`, `rollout-max-response-len 8192`:

| Phase | Time |
|---|---|
| Rollout (256 sequences) | 307 s |
| Train (ref log-probs 100 s + actor log-probs 33 s + backward/optimizer) | 415 s |
| Weight sync back to SGLang | 2.5 s |
| **Per step** | **≈ 12 min** |

`perf/tokens_per_gpu_per_sec` 478. Mean response length 4585 tokens, 33 % truncated at the
8192 cap. Step 0 reported `rollout/raw_reward` 0.64 and
`train/train_rollout_logprob_abs_diff` 0.010, i.e. the SGLang and Megatron forward passes
agree closely — see [True On-Policy](/examples/infra-features/true-on-policy) for what that
metric does and does not tell you.

## 5. Recipe Configuration

### 5.1 Parallelism

| TP | PP | CP | EP | `max_tokens_per_gpu` | SGLang `mem-fraction-static` | CPU Adam | GPUs |
|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|---|
| 4 | 1 | 1 | 1 | 8192 | 0.8 | ✓ | 8 (1 × 8) |

`--sequence-parallel` is enabled. Activation checkpointing is on
(`--recompute-granularity full --recompute-method uniform --recompute-num-layers 1`).

### 5.2 Algorithm

GRPO with low-variance KL:

```bash
--advantage-estimator grpo
--use-kl-loss
--kl-loss-coef 0.00
--kl-loss-type low_var_kl
--entropy-coef 0.00
--eps-clip 0.2
--eps-clip-high 0.28
```

### 5.3 Rollout & SGLang

```bash
--rollout-num-gpus-per-engine 1
--sglang-mem-fraction-static 0.8
```

One engine per GPU, inherited from the Qwen3.5 line.

**Why 0.8 and not the 0.5 the rest of the line uses.** The BF16 weights are ~53 GB per
engine. At 0.5 SGLang targets 70 GB of the H200's 140 GB, so after the weights only ~17 GB
is left for the pools — and it reports 69 GB still free. That matters more here than on a
plain transformer: 48 of the 64 layers are linear attention, and their recurrent state is
resident per sequence (48 v-heads × 128 × 128 × FP32 × 48 layers ≈ **151 MB per in-flight
sequence**), an order of magnitude above the KV cost. Measured on one node:

| | `mem-fraction-static 0.5` | `mem-fraction-static 0.8` |
|---|---|---|
| KV pool | 158,018 tok | 517,999 tok |
| GDN state slots (`mamba_cache_size`) | 60 | 198 |
| `#running-req` per engine | 11–12 | 39 |
| decode throughput per engine | 553–690 tok/s | 1855 tok/s |

Decode re-reads all 53 GB of weights every step regardless of batch size, so the small
batch was pure bandwidth waste. Under colocate the training model is offloaded to host RAM
during rollout, and the training-phase peak at 0.8 measured 88–90 GB of 140 GB, so the
higher fraction costs nothing. Two further levers if rollout is still the bottleneck:
`--rollout-num-gpus-per-engine 2` (halves per-GPU weights *and* shards the GDN state), and
`--sglang-mamba-ssm-dtype bfloat16` (halves the state, at a precision cost worth checking
against `train/train_rollout_logprob_abs_diff`).

### 5.4 Optimizer

CPU Adam is enabled (`--optimizer-cpu-offload --overlap-cpu-optimizer-d2h-h2d --use-precision-aware-optimizer`).

### 5.5 Notable quirks

From `scripts/models/qwen3.8-27B.py`, which defers to `scripts/models/qwen3.5-27B.py`:

- `--spec miles_plugins.models.qwen3_5 get_qwen3_5_spec` — Qwen3.8 reuses the Qwen3.5 spec (gated attention, FP32 `A_log`).
- `--rotary-base 10000000`, `--rotary-percent 0.25`.
- `--vocab-size 248320`.
- `--apply-layernorm-1p`, `--qk-layernorm`, `--group-query-attention`.
- `--attention-output-gate`.

See [Disk Offload](/advanced/disk-offload) for how miles keeps FP32-marked parameters like
the GDN `A_log` out of the low-precision optimizer path.

## 6. Qwen3.8-2.4T-A95B

The sparse 2.4 T / 95 B-active variant shares nothing operational with the dense 27 B: it
serves a ModelOpt **NVFP4** experts-only checkpoint from the rollout engine while the
Megatron trainer runs **BF16** off a `torch_dist` built from the dequantized weights, and
re-quantizes expert weights to NVFP4 at each weight-update boundary.

That recipe is **not part of this page's launcher**. It lands separately in
[radixark/miles#2488](https://github.com/radixark/miles/pull/2488) ("Qwen 3.8 day-0 lora RL
support"), which adds `scripts/run_qwen3_8.py` and the
`scripts/models/qwen3.8-2.4T-A95B{,_4layer,_full}.py` definitions.

Two things to know before reaching for it:

- **It is LoRA-only in practice.** The `--lora` path (native raw-mode LoRA, attention
  projections only, so the rollout MoE stays on `flashinfer_trtllm` unchanged) is the
  supported route; treat the full-weight path as unvalidated.
- **PR #2488 is still open** and stacked on a LoRA branch rather than `main`, so the recipe
  and its reproduction steps may still move. Follow the PR for the current shape.

## 7. Pairs Well With

- [Qwen3.5](/models/qwen/qwen3-5) — same architecture at 4 B / 9 B / 27 B
- [True On-Policy](/examples/infra-features/true-on-policy)
- [Low Precision RL](/advanced/low-precision)
