"""Heuristic run-health alarms and sglang config-tuning suggestions.

v2 orders the rules by what they claim: pipeline-liveness alarms first
(stalled phases, engine abort storms, degenerate reward groups), config
tuning last — and only on a run with no active alarm. The same observation
(low concurrency, low cache hit) means opposite things on a healthy and on
a starved run, so tuning advice on an unhealthy run would point the wrong
way: every production incident that motivated these rules began with "low
utilization" that was a symptom, not headroom.
